setup From the flow table of s1, we can see there is one rule (the last one) forwarding the packets to the controller. We call this rule as a barrier rule that used to achieve "is-not" statements by first installing a wildcard rule (r_w) and then installing a rule (r_h) with high priority than r_w matching m. As a result, r_w can match "is-not-m" and we call r_h a barrier rule to prevent a packet with m also matching r_w which is not correct. This sounds a little complex, but Maple can do it automatically! We can see the last rule at s1 can make an HTTP packet from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.2 go to the controller which prevent it matching the second one.
